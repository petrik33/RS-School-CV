## About Me

I am currently a first-course student of Belarusian State Univerity's Faculty of Applied Maths and Computer Science. The spheres of my interest in the world of IT are:

- Front-End Web Development
- Mobile Software
- Game Design/Programming

I started self-studying [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/ru/gamemaker) as my first game engine and after a year of solo work found a partner to collaborate with - young brazilian artist [Kure Mothri](https://linktr.ee/kuremothri). Together we started making a game, which is still in progress - Sunset Forest. ![Start Menu Screenshot](<./Images/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%20(598).png>)
I am really keen on working in a team of trusted people after my experience with Thirty Three Infinities Studio - this is how we called ourselves after adding sound designer and composer to us.
My current goals are to learn how to develop mobile apps using React Native and games using Unity and C# language.
